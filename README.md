# Capstone project information

## Project information

### Project name: Tabadul

### Project Overview

"Tabadul" is a community-based website that aims to promote sharing and reusing of products such as clothes and furniture among people living in the same region. The website encourages people to share their daily extra food, clothes, furniture, and other goods, particularly in disadvantaged communities such as refugee camps. The target audience for the website includes people who are looking to share or swap their goods.

The website's concept is simple, accessible, and impactful. It allows users to create an account, add new products, upload images, see listed products, filter products by criteria such as prices, order products that don’t exist on the website for other people to provide, and read blog posts. The website will be accessible on desktop and mobile web devices.

To ensure the safety and quality of products, the website requires that all products have real images posted to show the true quality of the products, and that users only share usable products that won’t be dangerous to other users.

Overall, "Tabadul" is a platform that enables community members to connect, share, and reuse products in an accessible and impactful way.
